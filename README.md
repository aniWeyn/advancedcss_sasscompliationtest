SASS Compliation

In this exercise I would like to check if you can successfully complie sass files through VS Code.

Create a simple project with a bit of style and small animation. 

[ ] Create a file index.html
[ ] Create folder assets
[ ] In the assets folder create style folder
[ ] In the style folder create a file index.scss, _colors.scss (and more files if you want)
[ ] Import partial files (_colors.scss etc) to the index.css 
[ ] Use Watch SASS to complie files
[ ] Link index.css file to the index.html file (link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles/index.css")
